It is important to get a rapid understanding about the overall health of a patient brought to a hospital. Covid-19 has made this all the more crucial as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded with patients in critical conditions. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often do not have medical histories of incoming patients. Patients themselves may be in distress, confused or unresponsive, and as such unable to provide information about any existing chronic conditions,such as heart disease, diabetes, etc. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.

Knowledge about chronic conditions such as diabetes can inform clinical decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This year's challenge was to use data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus.
